## Neural Network Verification for Time Series Forecasting

The implementation of the DLinear, Autoformer, PatchTST and SegRNN models have been adapted from the following repositories repectively:
- https://github.com/vivva/DLinear
- https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer
- https://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST
- https://github.com/lss-1138/SegRNN

The datasets used for training and testing the models can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy).
